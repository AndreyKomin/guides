# Welcome to the Team!

Below is your preparation plan, what need you to do during next 2 weeks to come better prepared.

- Setup Linux and software stack on your local PC (I prefer Linux Mint https://linuxmint.com, you may use Ubuntu)
- Please refer to the list of sources later in the email. We will have a meeting with you about goals, code review, and git flow during your first week, please make yourself prepared by reading the documentation. 
- If you have any questions - feel free to get in touch with Andrey Komin - andrey.komin@saritasa.com

# Preparation plan
We prepared the following preparation plan, so you can make yourself comfortable with technology stack we're using. 

## OS installation
We're using Linux and we encourage you to follow the same practices, although you can do a lot of things on Windows, certain aspects of development are much easier managed through Linux/Docker (which is not even possible on Windows), a lot of day2day operations are much faster and easier performed through terminal/CLI etc. Please - select & install the distro you like, and setup everything on your work and **home** PC/laptop. If needed - you can setup dual boot (like windows/Linux or mac/Linux) - there are plenty of tutorials are available on the Internet.

## Development Tools

Please be familiar with following tools and technologies (this is not complete tutorials):
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/)
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

You will need to install:

- Git
- Node (Recommend - Node Version Manager: [https://github.com/tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n))
- [Postman](getpostman.com)
- For screencasting: [Screencloud](https://screencloud.net/) or recordmydesktop (CLI) for video recordings



## IDE
You can use anything you're comfortable with, but we prefer [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=linux-version) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/download)

## Knowledge Needed
Pls spend time exploring, experimenting and understanding the following concepts and technologies.

### Gitflow
We're using GitFlow during our development cycle, so please become familiar with the [concept](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)

We highly recommend to read the book [Git For Teams](http://gitforteams.com), as well as watching the video lectures: [Collaborating with Git: Crafting Workflows at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034872.do) which I have available for you

### Code Review
We're using Upsource in our daily operations, so familiar with the process is quite recommended. Pls read the following articles:

- https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/features/
- https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/features/code_review.html
- https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/documentation/
- https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/help/2.0/codereview.html

You can work through web GUI or install WebStorm Upsource Plugin

Please let know if you have any _questions_!

thanks,
Andrey
